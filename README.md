# Cardano-Drep
Cardano Derep
#Hi I have been a Cardano holder for 5 years and I have decided it is time to start helping Cardano to become more decentralised and put my time and energy behind this blockchain that I really beleive in.
# I am looking forward to voting on governance and being involved in the higher level decisions that helps cardano become more decentralized and with your delegation I hope to receive more voting power and change the future for our kids and the monetary system. Fiat was good one it was backed by Gold but now its a scame. Lets go. Thanks for your help in delegating.
